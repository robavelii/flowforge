# Permission Matrix — RBAC & ABAC

> **Status:** Active · **Version:** 1.0 · **Last updated:** 2026-07-14

This document defines all permissions, system roles, and attribute-based policies in FlowForge. Permissions use the format `{resource}:{action}`.

## Permission Format

```
{resource}:{action}

Resources: organization, workspace, member, role, workflow, execution,
           webhook, secret, integration, file, audit, api_key, billing

Actions: read, write, create, delete, execute, manage, publish, admin
```

Wildcards supported in role definitions:

- `workflow:*` — all workflow actions
- `*:*` — full workspace admin (Owner role only)

---

## System Roles

System roles are predefined and cannot be deleted. Workspace admins can create **custom roles** as subsets.

| Role             | Scope     | Description                                               |
| ---------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Owner**        | Workspace | Full control including billing and deletion               |
| **Admin**        | Workspace | Manage members, settings, all resources                   |
| **Editor**       | Workspace | Create/edit/publish workflows, manage secrets             |
| **Operator**     | Workspace | Execute workflows, view executions, no structural changes |
| **Viewer**       | Workspace | Read-only access to workflows and executions              |
| **Billing**      | Workspace | View usage, manage billing (M8)                           |
| **System Admin** | Platform  | Internal ops; not assignable by customers                 |

### Role Hierarchy

```
Owner > Admin > Editor > Operator > Viewer
```

Higher roles inherit all permissions of lower roles **except** billing-specific permissions.

### Conditional Rules (◐)

| Permission        | Condition                                                                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `workflow:delete` | Editor can delete only workflows they created (`resource.createdBy = actorId`) |

---

## API Key Scopes

API keys are granted explicit scopes (subset of permissions). Predefined scope bundles:

| Scope Bundle       | Permissions Included                                        | Use Case                |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `read_only`        | All `*:read` permissions                                    | Monitoring, dashboards  |
| `workflow_runner`  | `workflow:read`, `workflow:execute`, `execution:read`       | CI/CD triggers          |
| `workflow_builder` | `workflow:*`, `secret:read`, `secret:write`                 | Integration development |
| `webhook_manager`  | `webhook:*`, `workflow:read`                                | Webhook configuration   |
| `full_access`      | All permissions except `workspace:delete`, `organization:*` | Server-side automation  |

Custom scopes: individual permissions can be selected when creating a key.

### Scope Enforcement

```typescript
@RequirePermission('workflow:execute')
@RequireScope('workflow:execute')  // Additional check for API key auth
async triggerExecution() { ... }
```

JWT user sessions use role-based permissions; API keys use scopes only (no role inheritance).

---

## ABAC Policies

Attribute-based policies augment RBAC for fine-grained control.

### Policy Structure

```typescript
interface AbacPolicy {
  id: string;
  workspaceId: string;
  name: string;
  effect: 'allow' | 'deny';
  permissions: string[]; // which permissions this policy applies to
  conditions: AbacCondition[];
}

interface AbacCondition {
  attribute:
    'resource.ownerId' | 'resource.teamId' | 'actor.teamId' | 'resource.tags' | 'environment';
  operator: 'equals' | 'not_equals' | 'in' | 'not_in';
  value: string | string[];
}
```

### Built-in ABAC Rules

| Policy                | Effect | Condition                                          | Applies To                                |
| --------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Owner-only delete     | deny   | `actor.role != Owner AND action = delete`          | `workspace:delete`, `organization:delete` |
| Creator delete        | allow  | `resource.createdBy = actorId`                     | `workflow:delete`                         |
| Production guard      | deny   | `environment = production AND actor.role = Editor` | `workflow:publish` (requires Admin+)      |
| Secret isolation      | deny   | `actor.role = Operator`                            | `secret:*`                                |
| Team scoping (future) | allow  | `resource.teamId IN actor.teamIds`                 | `workflow:read`, `workflow:write`         |

### Evaluation

ABAC policies are evaluated **after** RBAC grant. A deny policy overrides RBAC allow.

---

## Custom Roles

Workspace admins can create custom roles:

```json
POST /workspaces/:id/roles
{
  "name": "Integration Developer",
  "permissions": [
    "workflow:read",
    "workflow:write",
    "secret:read",
    "secret:write",
    "integration:read",
    "integration:write"
  ]
}
```

Constraints:

- Cannot grant permissions the creator doesn't hold
- Cannot create roles with `workspace:delete` or `organization:*`
- Maximum 20 custom roles per workspace
- Custom role names unique within workspace

---

## System Permissions

Platform-level permissions for internal `System Admin` role (not exposed to customers):

| Permission           | Description                         |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `system:admin`       | Access admin API endpoints          |
| `system:impersonate` | Impersonate user (support, audited) |
| `system:dlq`         | Manage dead letter queues           |
| `system:metrics`     | Access internal metrics             |
| `system:outbox`      | Replay outbox events                |

---

## Caching

Resolved permissions are cached per `(workspaceId, userId)` for 5 minutes. See [CACHING-STRATEGY.md](../architecture/CACHING-STRATEGY.md).

Invalidation triggers: `MemberAdded`, `MemberRemoved`, `MemberRoleChanged`, custom role mutations.
